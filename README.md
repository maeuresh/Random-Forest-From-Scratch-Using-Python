# Random-Forest-From-Scratch-Using-Python

This project implements a Random Forest classifier from scratch using Python. A Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve classification or regression accuracy. By averaging the predictions of multiple trees, Random Forest reduces the risk of overfitting and increases model robustness.
